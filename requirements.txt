# Project dependencies.
# NOTE: This project uses the modern IBM Quantum Runtime client: `qiskit-ibm-runtime`.
# The runtime client (qiskit-ibm-runtime) is the recommended way to access IBM Quantum
# hardware/primitives (Estimator/Sampler V2). The older ibm-provider is deprecated/migrated â€”
# use qiskit-ibm-runtime and the QiskitRuntimeService/IBMProvider APIs as shown in src/connect_ibm.py.
#
# Keep minimum/locked versions where present in the current venv; add reasonable minimums
# for common extras used during development (simulators, plotting, notebooks).
